#Things I have learned at Bloc.io#
1. HTML5
    1. I have learned that HTML5 is no longer just an HTML standard but is in reality HTML5, CSS and Javascript together as one web platform.  I have learned many of the tags and elements that make up the HTML5 standard.
1. CSS3
    1. I have learned Cascading Style Sheets syntax.  I have had worked with HTML in the past but CSS is completely new to me so it has been exciting to work with a new technology.  I've learn how to select elements from the html document and use the properties to style it's display.
1. Markdown 
    1. I've begun to learn the markdown language for git hub and I am attempting to use it here. *Hopefully it will be a successful attempt.*
1. Git and GitHub
    1. Git and Git hub is another new technology for me.  I have heard about it for a long time but didn't want to tackle it on my own.

**Now I just have to figure out how to submit this and I should be good to GO!!**
